# Hi there!👋 I'm Marly 
**Welcome to my GitHub profile ✨**.

- 🚀 After three years working as a **Mechanical Engineer** in the heavy machinery industry, motivated by various factors, including the desire to express my creativity in my work activities, I decided to redirect my career towards **Frontend Development**.

- 👩‍💻 I have been working on several personal projects involving **CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS**, which you can explore here on my GitHub profile.

- 🌱 Currently, I am strengthening my knowledge.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [Nazhir Edbaissi](https://github.com/nazhG) and [Oscar Barajas](https://github.com/gndx).

- 😄 Nick: guarichona.

- 📬 You can find me at:
