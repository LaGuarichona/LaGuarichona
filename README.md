- 👩‍💻 I have been working on several personal projects involving **CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS**, which you can explore here on my GitHub profile.

- 🌱 Currently, I am strengthening my knowledge.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [Nazhir Edbaissi](https://github.com/nazhG) and [Oscar Barajas](https://github.com/gndx).
